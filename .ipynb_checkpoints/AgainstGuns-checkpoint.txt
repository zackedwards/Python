"Maybe, guns are not the issue. Talking about guns is a distraction. This argument just runs in circles. It does not solve problems. We need to train more and more people to be law-abiding. Maybe, "How to be law-abiding" could be a required class in high school. Thank you."

"Having a gun is okay, there's nothing wrong with that. But, hiding the guns makes people nervous, and can potentially lead to a huge firefight. Like I said before, you can keep your guns, because it IS stated in the 2nd Amendment that Americans have the right to bear arms. Just don't hide the guns! It just seems suspicious."

"Guns can be used against you if a criminal is near you and steals it away, also people only think about the moment. People could not know what there doing and kill someone over a very small thing....Also you never know who could buy a gun. It could be a nice cool person like us... or it could be a full on murderer.. i dont think we should take that chance."

"As an evidence, South Korea is a country where almost everyone, except the military and the police I guess. And this country has a really low crime rate. How about comparing countries with and without the right to bear arms. Unless we trash all the psychos and aggressive people into the jail and everyone has a gun fair and square. And plus, what about the kids? They don't have any guns. Even in schools, then they should have the right to get guns. But, there's another problem, what about some people having more skills in shooting and others don't? Also, kids may not be mentally and physically trained enough to use the gun. And of course the government is not going to give the guns to the children in the first place."

"I believe that concealed handguns are both good and bad ideas, but i am more on the "bad" side of this issue. 
First of all, shootings and deaths happen BECAUSE of concealed weapons and/or firearms.
Secondly, if a law passed saying that weapons and/or firearms were illegal to carry, the number of issues including weapons and/or firearms would decrease. Physical harm (hand-to-hand combat) would still be a problem, but that is not the main issue.
Lastly, citizens and locals would feel safer knowing no one had concealed weapons, that they had a small chance of being harmed, and that less people would be potential threats."

"There are only 2 reasons that I can think of for carrying a gun in public. 1= to commit a crime. 2= to protect yourself from dangerous people. If we didn't allow the dangerous people to carry guns in public, then why would the people in group 2 need to carry guns? 

What defines a law-abiding citizen? Someone who has never broken the law. Adam Lanza (the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter) had no previous criminal record, yet he was allowed to carry a gun in public.

The Second Amendment does not state that all law-abiding citizens are allowed to carry guns in public. It merely says that we have a "right to keep and bear arrms". 

Guns don't kill people; people kill people. Guns, however, make it easier to kill people. If you went out in public and a psycho pulled out his gun and pointed it at you, do you really think that you also having a gun would make him stop? If your psycho enough to point a gun at someone in public, then there's not much to stop you from using it. 

If you and a stranger both have guns, it's really a matter of who shoots first. Your gun can't protect you when a bullet is flying at you, can it?"

"There are exactly 3 things required for a gun death to occur: a gun, a bullet, and a shooter. Remove any one of them from the equation and nobody dies. The NRA's position is that more guns and bullets will prevent gun deaths. It logically follows then that the NRA must believe we should remove all the shooters. Works for me."

"Criminals do not get their guns legally! How many Politicians, that are whining about guns, have armed body guards? They believe that a good man with a gun can shoot the bad man with a gun before the bad man gets to them. If we do away with guns for people that follow the laws, the only people with guns will be the people in service and the criminal. How many weapons has our government supplied to other countries? Our government is giving weapons to other countries at our expense, using our tax dollars to supply other countries. Why has our government made the largest ammunition purchase in receint history and then want to band guns for its citizens? I am truely sad that we have people that will kill little children! The person that did this did not get his guns legally, and had no history. There is no way we can know who, or when someone will snap and the rest of us should be able to protect ourself when it happens. I like the idea of having an armed officer at every school. We should also have a nurse at every school! But it seems more important to our government that we support other countries instead of our own."

If you give an untrained idiot with a gun and let him roam free on the streets this will do no good. He will react to any situation that seems unjust to him.

"The main question is, why should someone have the need to CONCEAL their weapon? As the law in WI stood in the past, one could carry his/her own weapon around in public, provided that it was in plain site. Now, I understand the notion that having the right to concealed carry is intended to act as a deterrent to street violence in general, but it's a double-edged sword that we're dealing with here: while we may have empowered well-meaning citizens, we have ALSO empowered deviants, people who overreact under pressure (i.e. someone who may wrongfully apply deadly force as opposed to going for the kneecap, e.g. the Bo Morrison case), and piss-poor marksman (e.g. "Damn! I missed him. Sorry about your kneecap, miss!").

As a 3rd degree blackbelt, a teacher in self-defense seminars, and a man who's traveled to some of the most dangerous countries in the world, I can tell you first hand that the most effective method of self defense is STREET SMARTS, not engaging in violence. With any amount of good sense about you, you can prevent most situations before they even happen."

"Are there examples where an armed citizen stepped into the middle of a mass-shooting and shot the offender? I have not heard of any but there certainly could be.

The vast majority of citizens are in fact allowed to carry weapons but they choose not to, are pro-gun folks asking that we all should be forced to carry guns?

We need to make it very very hard to get a hand gun or any other weapon. We need to end the ability to get guns without a serious background check (like at gun shows and online). Yes, truly evil people will get them,but if there are fewer floating around then they will be harder to get. We should no longer care about the profits of gun companies.

"I, unfortunately, fully understand the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A private citizen has nothing to do with the state's ability to maintain a well established militia. This topic is a dead horse, the NRA is way too powerful and the economic interest of gun manufactures is too potent. When the violence finally gets to the point that the police are outgunned (as they currently are in many cities), the citizens will take the responsible route."
