"there is no other organization dedicated (and staffed) to PREVENT immediate threats... Police ARE NOT there to prevent, they are intended only to investigate AFTER any incident or threat has occurred, which is always too late.

Everyone has the right to defend themselves with equal or greater force. Sure people used black powder back in the day... however, the right to bear arms wasn't written to only include those same weapons at the time. It was written to allow defense of whatever weapons are able to be threatened by."

"Yes i think people should carry concealed weapons because, think about your safety and those of people around you. Maybe if teachers could carry concealed hand guns. ( I know this is a sensitive subject) It may have helped prevent more lives being lost at school shootings. It would have saved lives. There will always be a risk of a psychopath who will kill some one no matter what, but in the world there are more good people then bad and that is why concealed weapons and other gun restricting laws should be dropped"

"Ok, for example like last night there was a shooting at FSU Wounded 3 people but he got stopped within 10 mins or less. If we have officer offcials watching out on the public we are doing great. There are many reasons why we should have a gun though. It should be used in the right way and not the harmful way. Thats like putting someone in a cell with murders and him just standing there while 5 other guys with felonys hitting on him and on and on...If you want to make someone suffer more im just saying "Guns cant control themselves, people control it" so if we can some how control the people from not raging on others everything will be safe."

We are animals. That is a fact. We have biological and emotional standards we need to uphold. Telling someone to do something (Law) does not prevent someone from doing it. To decide what is morally right and wrong is up to the persons judgment, NOT another person judgment. That being said, our emotions get in the way of correct thinking somtimes...Getting hopped up on jack and coke on a saturday night and trying to start a scuffel with somone is probably not a good idea. now if this guy had a gun, he could end his life, UNWILLINGLY. (not being conscientious). jealousy, anger, rage and many other emotions is the first thing as a species that we need to regulate and educate people on. that being said it will take many generations to confront that issue, im assuming. we need rpotection for these other animals for now, and somthing we can crontol is who we give it to, and what we give to him.

"most of my family caries a concealed hand gun and the moment I am allowed to there is no way I'm not because its the people who are holding the gun not the gun that's killing people so by having one for the purpose of stopping people from dying sure seems like a good idea. if guns were banned more people would want them there for there would be more on the streets. scary thought if you ask me. But people should have to go through a system of tests and such to make sure that the person should be able to have a gun on them in public."

"Keeping people from carrying guns DOES NOT PROTECT, it endangers those whom need protection. Criminals are going to break the law regardless, so why punish those who aren't breaking the law by putting them in harms' way by taking away their protection. NOT EVERYONE CAN FIGHT, not everyone can defend themselves against those who wish to hurt people or mug them or rape them. MALE OR FEMALE, It does not matter. Everyone is vulnerable when you take away this right. Police, FBI, CIA, the military are allowed to carry. Why do they carry? FOR THEIR SAFETY AND SAFETY OF OTHERS. We can't all be good at martial arts, or large muscular people who can defend themselves, there is only so much you can do against someone who DOES have a gun ILLEGALLY. Protect the people, make them train before they can get a gun make them have a license. Put them through the paces but then allow the guns. Because sometimes that's the only option for people"

"Laws are not tangible. What I mean is, a law can not PHYSICALLY stop something from occurring. If one person is going to kill another person, a law can't jump out and disable them, preventing the crime. Here's a newsflash, it's already illegal to kill another person or person(s). Making MORE laws that also make it illegal to carry a firearm cannot help, because we already know that the person about to kill another, is already breaking the law.
I do believe there should be some level of gun control. None of us want someone mentally unstable or drunk to be carrying a gun. So saying the 2nd amendment is absolute is a bit extreme. But passing new laws that will only make it harder for law abiding citizens to protect themselves and their families, when we already know that criminals don't follow laws, is just silly. Its called 'feel good legislation' and always does more harm than good. It's a tough job, but our government needs to look at the entire picture, use some common sense and logic, and make some hard decisions. Not just cater to the whims of the tragically uninformed."

"There is merit to the argument that more people carrying concealed firearms will increase the number of gun-related injuries, it is not true that crime will increase. In order to get a concealed-carry permit, strict guidelines are in place regarding criminal history, meaning that people who qualify for permits are generally law-abiding citizens already. I believe that this trend would hold true, especially as the population ages. Typically, older people commit less serious crime as they age. Serious, habitual offenders rarely qualify to own firearms, and would not legally be entitled to carry a firearm."

They do allow you to submit the forms but the police chief has to approve it. We live on the Big Island and have a problem with "ICE" and the violence that is associated with it. I am disabled and feel I should be able to protect my family and myself at home and while away. What are you going to do when you are with your loved ones and three thugs on "ICE" trying to rob you?

"Washington State is a shall issue state. Almost all firearms deaths in my area of Washington are Mexican on Mexican (or Hispanic on Hispanic, if you wish) and most of these are illegal "immigrants" and Hispanic felons who are illegally in possession of the gun. I'm sure that most of these involve drug trafficking or the "machismo factor." Licensed concealed carry folks are a miniscule to non-existent portion of the murder by firearm statistics in this state. In fact, as near as I can glean, there have been more murders, not in the line of duty, by active and retired police. If the right to concealed carry and, consequently, the right to be equally powerful as your adversary, were to vanish as many wish the rate of firearms deaths would not be affected as CCW folks aren't the ones doing the killing but the rate of assault by those of greater strength and with other deadly weapons would go up. Statistics show that concealed carry and firearms are not the problem - it is still the damn individual that is the problem. If all guns were confiscated today (a Democrat desire) there would be little or no effects on murder rates as only the law abiding folks would turn in their guns. Only a fool thinks they are safer with no guns."

"Getting assaulted by an adult with a gun while being unarmed can be just as dangerous as being assaulted while carrying a concealed weapon. The attacker wont necessarily know whether or not his/her prey is carrying an armed weapon. However, just having the armed gun will serve as an extra line of defense for an innocent life if it is used responsibly. Not everybody with an armed weapon should immediately resort to their weapon in dangerous situations, but should rather remain calm and only make use of their armed weapon when it is needed."

"Being trained on the subject of a handgun and knowing how to properly use one can make a dire situation managable. Most fatal accidents involve a child or preteen 13 and under. If asked on their knowledge of guns they may know very little or none at all towards guns and what they can do. Thats on the parernts for not properly educating their children! That doesnt mean having a gun is a bad thing. Criminals will get ahold of a firearm no matter how much we ban and remove them.

"There are actually a lot of places in the world that allow this and their crime rate is low; Mainly, in my opinion is that when everyone is packing heat the risk of getting shot for doing a felony is high or the fact of just knowing that some one has the potential to shoot me comes into a survival instinct in the brain. Besides would you want to risk facing someone who may have a bigger more powerful gun than you? And just think about how many things could be prevented such as rapes, child abduction, assault, home burglary that could end badly, abduction.

"Those who would empower government to prevent an individual's choice and ability to defend themselves are likely projecting their personal security circumstances on every individual in the world. That would be wrong headed. Your situation is not everyone's situation - certainly not the situation of all future victims of evil. 

Another angle is anti gun rights people are working to diminish the people's ability to resist government tyranny. Giving a government blanket authority to arrest anyone found with a gun, is serious political power that cannot be understated. Today, a level of tyranny in government exists – think IRS, NSA, DHS. I ask those who gladly hand their government more power over their people how sure they are that 20 - 30 years from now government tyranny will not have become unbearable in this country. Keep in mind the level of freedoms your children's children get to enjoy shall depend on how accurate your judgment today is. 

For those of you who feel our countries founding fathers concerns about government tyranny should be dropped as a concern, I ask you to explain why. What changed? Did the government somehow get staffed with angels while I wasn’t looking?"

"Allowing a certain small and qualified portion of the population (non-police citizens) to carry concealed guns and ensuring that this portion is homogeneously spread around the United States will create a higher chance for crimes to be stopped while also maintain the safety of by-standards from under-qualified individuals who would have otherwise been able to carry a concealed weapon. Weapon carrying should be legalized, but only to those who pass a strict psychological and physical tests that can ensure the carried weapons are in good hands."
