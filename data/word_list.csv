Voters
in
Florida
Illinois
Missouri
North
Carolina
and
Ohio
cast
crucial
ballots
in
the
race
for
the
presidency
on
Tuesday
Here
are
some
of
the
things
we
will
be
watching
and
where
you
can
find
our
live
updates
The
end
or
the
beginning
The
Republican
presidential
campaign
will
not
end
next
week
or
even
next
month
But
voters
in
the
five
states
casting
ballots
on
Tuesday
will
go
a
long
way
toward
determining
whether
Donald
J
Trump
can
win
the
delegates
necessary
to
claim
the
party
nomination
If
Mr
Trump
loses
Ohio
possible
or
Florida
less
likely
and
wins
less-than-commanding
victories
in
Illinois
Missouri
and
North
Carolina
he
would
face
the
strong
possibility
of
falling
short
of
a
delegate
majority
and
entering
a
contested
Republican
convention
this
summer
But
with
victories
in
the
home
states
of
two
of
his
rivals
he
could
end
the
campaigns
of
Gov
John
Kasich
of
Ohio
and
Senator
Marco
Rubio
of
Florida
leaving
Senator
Ted
Cruz
of
Texas
as
the
only
candidate
still
standing
in
his
way
No
two
states
loom
larger
on
the
general
election
map
than
Florida
and
Ohio
and
the
results
there
could
offer
clues
to
the
mood
of
the
bellwether
voters
going
into
the
fall
campaign
If
Mr
Trump
dispatches
Ohio
two-term
governor
and
Florida
young
senator
it
would
suggest
that
he
is
close
to
wresting
the
Republican
nomination
And
that
would
quickly
force
other
elected
Republicans
there
to
decide
how
tightly
they
want
to
embrace
a
candidate
who
even
with
his
victories
in
the
primary
could
prove
repellent
to
the
sort
of
up-for-grabs
voters
most
coveted
in
these
pre-eminent
swing
states
This
calculation
could
also
prove
consequential
in
the
Senate
campaign
as
both
states
have
Republican-held
seats
at
stake
that
could
determine
the
balance
of
power
in
that
chamber
Even
as
Ohio
economy
has
recovered
since
the
Great
Recession
manufacturing
jobs
have
continued
to
vanish
Should
Mr
Trump
and
Senator
Bernie
Sanders
of
Vermont
on
the
Democratic
side
win
Ohio
it
will
be
in
part
because
of
their
ferocious
assault
on
the
United
States
international
trade
agreements
a
line
of
attack
that
also
lifted
them
in
Michigan
The
economic
conditions
in
the
state
have
undermined
support
for
free
trade
among
voters
and
leaders
in
both
parties
That
augurs
for
a
general
election
where
the
eventual
party
nominees
will
confront
immense
pressure
to
abandon
the
bipartisan
free-trade
consensus
that
has
shaped
every
modern
presidential
administration
Forget
them
not
Illinois
and
Missouri
have
a
lot
in
common
besides
being
Midwestern
states
that
share
the
Mississippi
River
Both
have
been
obscured
by
the
action
in
Florida
and
Ohio
which
are
winner-take-all
contests
for
Republicans
and
elimination
races
for
Mr
Kasich
and
Mr
Rubio
But
Illinois
and
Missouri
which
allocate
a
handful
of
delegates
to
the
statewide
winner
and
the
rest
to
the
top
vote-getter
in
each
of
their
congressional
districts
could
be
just
as
important
If
Mr
Trump
overwhelms
his
competition
in
each
capturing
every
congressional
district
he
could
effectively
turn
them
into
winner-take-all
states
But
Mr
Kasich
has
aggressively
campaigned
in
the
Chicago
area
and
Mr
Cruz
has
stumped
in
nearly
every
corner
of
both
the
states
If
together
they
can
win
a
substantial
number
of
the
combined
congressional
districts
in
both
contests
it
would
limit
Mr
Trump
haul
and
mitigate
the
impact
of
his
winning
Florida
Ohio
or
both
The
biggest
wild
card
may
be
the
heavily
black
congressional
districts
in
Chicago
St
Louis
and
Kansas
City
They
offer
the
same
number
of
delegates
as
the
most
conservative
Republican
districts
in
the
rural
reaches
of
each
state
Mr
Rubio
has
fared
best
in
cities
so
far
but
his
collapse
offers
opportunities
to
the
other
Republican
hopefuls
